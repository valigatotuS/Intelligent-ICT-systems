    "Let’s see how the tree represented in the decision tree graph makes predictions. Suppose you find an iris flower and you want to classify it. You start at the root node (depth 0, at the top): this node asks whether the flower’s petal length is smaller than 2.45 cm. If it is, then you move down to the root’s left child node (depth 1, left). In this case, it is a leaf node (i.e., it does not have any children nodes), so it does not ask any questions: you can simply look at the predicted class for that node and the Decision Tree predicts that your flower is an Iris-Setosa (class=setosa).\n",
    "Now suppose you find another flower, but this time the petal length is greater than 2.45 cm. You must move down to the root’s right child node (depth 1, right), which is not a leaf node, so it asks another question: is the petal width smaller than 1.75 cm? If it is, then your flower is most likely an Iris-Versicolor (depth 2, left). If not, it is likely an Iris-Virginica (depth 2, right). \n",
    "A node’s samples attribute counts how many training instances it applies to. For example, 100 training instances have a petal length greater than 2.45 cm (depth 1, right), among which 54 have a petal width smaller than 1.75 cm (depth 2, left).\n",
    "A node’s value attribute tells you how many training instances of each class this node applies to: for example, the bottom-right node applies to 0 Iris-Setosa, 1 Iris-Versicolor, and 45 Iris-Virginica.\n",
    "Finally, a node’s gini attribute measures its impurity: a node is “pure” (gini=0) if all training instances it applies to belong to the same class. For example, since the depth-1 left node applies only to Iris-Setosa training instances, it is pure and its gini score is 0. Equation shows how the training algorithm computes the gini score Gi of the ith node. For example, the depth-2 left node has a gini score equal to 1 – (0/54)2 – (49/54)2 – (5/54)2 ≈ 0.168.\n",

    "Another way of analyzing the tree instead of looking at the whole tree at once is a feature importance calculation.  Feature importance is typically a number between 0 and 1 that's assigned to an individual feature. It indicates how important that feature is to the overall prediction accuracy. A feature importance of zero means that the feature is not used at all in the prediction. A feature importance of one, means the feature perfectly predicts the target. Typically, feature importance numbers are always positive and they're normalized so they sum to one. In scikit-learn, feature importance values are stored as a list in an estimated property called feature_importances_."

It simply means that the particular feature wasn't chosen at an early level of the tree and this could be because the feature may be identical or highly correlated with another informative feature and so doesn't provide any new additional signal for prediction. \n",

    "While the test data is a little bit worse. This is an indication that the tree is likely overfitting and in fact this is a problem with building decision trees in general that keep adding rules until the leafnodes are pure. Typically such trees are overly complex and essentially memorized the training data. So when building decision trees, we need to use some additional strategy to prevent this overfitting. One strategy to prevent overfitting is to prevent the tree from becoming really detailed and complex by stopping its growth early. This is called pre-pruning. Another strategy is to build a complete tree with pure leaves but then to prune back the tree into a simpler form. This is called post-pruning or sometimes just pruning. The decision tree implementation and scikit-learn only implements pre-pruning. We can control tree complexity via pruning by limiting either the maximum depth of the tree using the max depth parameter or the maximum number of leafnodes using the max leafnodes parameter. We could also set a threshold on the minimum number of instances that must be in a node to consider splitting it. And this would be using the min samples leaf parameter we can see the effect of pre-pruning by setting max depth to three on the iris dataset.\n"
